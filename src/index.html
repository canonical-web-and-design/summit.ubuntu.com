      <h1>Welcome to Ubuntu Summit 2022</h1>
      <p>The Ubuntu Summit is an opportunity for the broader Ubuntu community to learn and speak about the amazing work and success stories happening in the ecosystem. We want to enable a wide and diverse group to connect, collaborate, and lower the barriers between what they do best and how Ubuntu can help achieve that.</p>
      <p>Let us get together in <strong>Prague, Czech Republic from November 7&ndash;9th, 2022</strong> to celebrate the spirit of Ubuntu â€” I am what I am because of who we all are.</p>

    <h2>You mean developer summit, right?</h2>
    <p>For those of you who know and love our <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperSummit">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a>, last hosted in 2012, you may be wondering about the change in name. Canonical has grown a lot as an organization, and the Ubuntu community has excelled into many new areas. Instead of focusing on the roadmap for the next release, we'd like to change the scope to focus on the broader community. The new Ubuntu Summit will occur annually, in changing locations across the world.</p>
